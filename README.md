# TableProject
This HTML-CSS Projects represents a simple webpage displaying a "Final Examination Schedule" for the Fall 2008 semester. Creates a clean and organized layout for displaying exam schedules, with subject names and times aligned under each day of the week.

"I would carefully replicate the table structure using semantic HTML table tags, and apply clean CSS for borders, spacing, background colors, and text alignment to match the image exactly."
